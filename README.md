## The use of liri-node-app
* LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

* LIRI takes the following commands "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", "concert-this", "do-what-it-says"

* If the user doesn't put any userinput, the app will take some default userinput and display the related data.
